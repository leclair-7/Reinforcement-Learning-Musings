# Reinforcement-Learning-Musings

Want to make a 2-D environment that can easily take key or neural network inputs to control an agent in a world. The idea is to change environment complexity to see how quickly an agent setup can learn it. After that we'll vary the inputs like line of sight and have a concept of enemy hiding, agent sight, etc.

Also a learning tool for Sutton and Barto's RL book which entails a grid world to use Bellman Equations and Dyna-Q among other things
